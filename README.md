# NFSU2 Unlimiter
NFSU2 Unlimiter is a script mod which fixes some issues for added cars:
+ Added cars cannot be seen in game. (Increased CarTypeID limit and block size variables to solve the problem.)
+ Selecting added cars make the game crash. (Increased CarTypeID limit.)
+ And more...

The unlimiter also has options to change car render information, which works on all cars: (Just add CARNAME.ini into UnlimiterData folder.)
+ LinkLicensePlateToTrunk: Attaches license plate to trunk for part animations.
+ ShowTrunkUnderInFE: Shows inside of the trunk while in menus.
+ RemoveCentreBrakeWithCustomSpoiler: Removes centre brakelight position marker when a custom spoiler is installed.
+ HasSunroof: Swaps KIT00_ROOF with KIT00_FULLROOF when a roof scoop is installed.
